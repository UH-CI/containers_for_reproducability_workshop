    "* Run (and modify!) existing Docker containers\n",

    "### 4.6 Bind Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "When Singularity creates the new file system inside a container it ignores directories that are not part of the standard kernel, e.g. `/scratch`, `/xdisk`, `/global`, etc. These paths can be added back into the container by binding them when the container is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t$ singularity shell --bind /xdisk ubuntu14.simg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system administrator can also define what is added to a container. This is important on campus HPC systems that often have a `/scratch` or `/xdisk` directory structure. By editing the `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` a new path can be added to the system containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.7 Overlay\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make changes to an immutable container which only persist for the duration of the container being run.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, download a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a new image in the ext3 format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\t$ singularity image.create blank_slate.simg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
